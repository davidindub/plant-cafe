# Plant Cafe

<img alt="The project displayed on a phone, tablet, laptop and desktop computer." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69420622/153647576-32cab957-ec42-4734-901e-5e8ecb1dcc6a.jpg">


The project is to make a simple website for a Cafe and Houseplant Shop in Dublin City.

The shop serves specialty coffee and plant-based food, sells houseplants in store and frequently hosts events about growing plants.

The plants are not sold online, but the website will include some tips on keeping houseplants, as well as a signup form for a newsletter on upcoming events.

The main target of the website are people looking for quick information such as the food & drinks menu, or the location and opening hours of the shop and it is expected most of these visitors will be checking the website quickly on a mobile device. Delivering this information quickly and clearly is the main aim of the project, and the language used is friendly and welcoming.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - All pages feature the same responsive navigation bar with links to the Landing Page, Food Menu, Location & Contact Form, and Events page. This allows the user to easily navigate the site.

  - The page the user is currently on is marked with a subtle underline to aide navigation.

  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

  - The landing page features a large eye catching photograph with text overlayed, and a button which when clicked scrolls the page down to the most important information the users might be looking for.
  The text adapts so that the image does not get obscured different screens sizes.


- __Cards on Landing Page__

  - Three cards with related photographs describe the three pages of the website where the user might like to visit.
  - Clicking anywhere on each of these cards takes the user to the associated page, making the links easy to tap on mobile. There is a subtle underline and color change on hover/focus.

- __The Footer__

  - The footer section includes the physical address and email address of the cafe, navigation links to the other pages of the website, and links to the cafe's social media accounts (all open in a new tab so as not to end the users visit to the Plant Cafe site)
  - The footer is responsive, the three sections and the nav links stack on mobile view, but use the extra available space on larger screens.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- I deployed the project to GitHub pages. I had previously set up a custom domain with GitHub Pages for my personal landing page, so the URL features my own domaim.

The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
